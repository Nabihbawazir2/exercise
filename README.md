**22. GitHub Profile Analyzer**

- **Student's Task:** Use the GitHub API to fetch data about their own repositories (or a famous open-source project). Use Pandas to analyze the number of commits, stars, and forks.
- **Trainer's Task:** Assist in creating a profile page that showcases these stats in a more visually engaging way than the standard GitHub interface.
